A FASTA alignment of 5S ribosomal RNA.
5S.T.alnfasta
http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/DAT/3C/Alignment/Files/5S/5S.T.alnfasta.zip
It includes taxa from: Archaea Bacteria Chloroplast Eukaryota Mitochondria.
In the alignment, taxa marked as dividers separate the taxonomic groups.

A newick file that I typed in by hand.
It is from the paper:
"The relative inefficiency of sequence weights approaches
in determining a nucleotide position weight matrix"
In turn, this paper cites the tree as coming from the paper:
"Molecular phylogeny of old world monkeys (cercopithecidae)
as inferred from gamma-globin DNA sequences."
Branch lengths are 1e4 times the expected number of substitutions on the branch.

Latitude and longitude of some cities in the United States.
These cities are near Raleigh.
These can be used as procrustes transformation targets
and for multidimensional scaling.

Latitude and longitude of some cities in the United States.
These cities are widely spread across the continental United States.
These can be used as procrustes transformation targets
and for multidimensional scaling.

A graphical layout of a tree in a notebook of Darwin.
Each line in the POINTS section gives the index of the point,
the x coordinate of the point, and the y coordinate of the point.
Each line in the EDGE section gives two point indices connected by an edge.

Some (RR, RA, AA, AB) counts for aligned reads at genome positions.
RR is the homozygous reference nucleotide count,
RA is the heterozygous reference and non-reference nucleotide count,
AA is the homozygous non-reference nucleotide count, and
AB is the heterozygous non-reference and non-reference nucleotide count.
Each row in the file gives counts for a single genome position.
Each row sum is the read coverage at the position.

20100730a.dat
Each line has information about a column of aligned reads.
The data represents a single chromosome.

20100730b.dat
Each line has information about a column of aligned reads.
The data represents two chromosomes.

20100730c.dat
Each line has information about a column of aligned reads.
The data represents two chromosomes.
