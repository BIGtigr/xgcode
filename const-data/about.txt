"The relative inefficiency of sequence weights approaches
in determining a nucleotide position weight matrix"
In turn, this paper cites the tree as coming from the paper:

Some (RR, RA, AA, AB) counts for aligned reads at genome positions.
RR is the homozygous reference nucleotide count,
RA is the heterozygous reference and non-reference nucleotide count,
AA is the homozygous non-reference nucleotide count, and
